This is for the specific use case of two linearly correlated variables, 
where you care about the gradient, and you want to plot vertical and horizontal uncertainties 
as well as maximum and minimum gradients.

# How to use
1. Install python
2. `git clone https://github.com/revers3ntropy/data-plotter.git`
3. `cd data-plotter`
4. Edit the config.py file (e.g. `sudo nano config.py`)
5. `python3 __main__.py`



This uses polynomial regression to find the lines of best fit.
